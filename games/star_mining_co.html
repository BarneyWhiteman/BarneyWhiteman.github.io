                    Use your customisable super-drill to carve your way through asteroids to reveal the riches held within. Use your new-found wealth to buy upgraded parts for even faster destruction! But be careful - failure to make a profit for Star Mining Co. will terminate your contract, and YOU, permanently!

                <em class="fancy">Star Mining Co.</em> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2584800/"><em class="fancy">OUT NOW</em> on Steam</a>! I made the game from scratch in Java using <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> as a library to handle all the graphics and what not.
