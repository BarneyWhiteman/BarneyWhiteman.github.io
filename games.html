                Here are some links to games I've made. The plan is for this list to grow significantly over time!

                    Use your customisable super-drill to carve your way through asteroids to reveal the riches held within. Use your new-found wealth to buy upgraded parts for even faster destruction! But be careful - failure to make a profit for Star Mining Co. will terminate your contract, and YOU, permanently!

                I'm currently working on a rogue-like called <em class="fancy">Star Mining Co.</em> which you can wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2584800/">Steam</a>! I'm making it from scratch in Java using <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> as a library to handle all the graphics and what not.
                <br/>
                Playtesting is currently open too, so if you want to try it out for yourself, head over to the Steam page and get involved! Make sure you join my <a href="https://discord.gg/Qnc3jWTeEW">Discord server</a> as well so you can share your feedback.

            </a>
            <p>Fractal finder is a simple little game of hide and seek. You get given an image somewhere in the fractal and your job is to find where it's hidden.</p>

            <p>
                Cheers, and happy coding!
