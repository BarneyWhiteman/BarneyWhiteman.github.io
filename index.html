            <p>
                G'day I'm <b>Barney</b>, and I have a passion for game dev and creative coding.
            </p>

            <p>
                I share tutorials and devlogs on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@BarneyCodes">YouTube</a> channel
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently working on a rogue-like called <em>Star Mining Co.</em> which you can wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2584800/">Steam</a>! I'm making it from scratch in Java using <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> as a library to handle all the graphics and what not.
                <br/>
                It's probably not the most sane choice, but it's working for me. I'll most likely change that up for the game though.
                <br/>
                Playtesting is currently open too, so if you want to try it out for yourself, head over to the Steam page and get involved! Make sure you join my <a href="https://discord.gg/Qnc3jWTeEW">Discord server</a> as well so you can share your feedback.
            </p>

                The best way to get in touch is probably either via <a href="mailto:barney@barneycodes.com?subject=Getting%20in%20touch">Email</a> or on <a href="https://discord.gg/Qnc3jWTeEW">Discord</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cheers, and happy coding!
