            <p>
                G'day I'm <b>Barney</b>, and I have a passion for game development and creative coding.
            </p>

            <h2>A bit about me:</h2>
            <p>
                My first taste of game dev was during high school when I saw the kid next to me following a tutorial on how to make simple Flash games, and I decided that I wanted to join the fun!
            </p>
            <p>
                This early introduction to programming lead me down the path of studying a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours, Majoring in Software at the University of Queensland. I then spent 5 years in the corporate software world while
                working on passion projects and the Barney Codes <a href="https://youtube.com/@BarneyCodes">YouTube channel</a> in any spare moments I could muster.
            </p>
            <p>
                In July 2024 I decided to step away from the corporate scene and take a chance persuing the things I was truly interested in.
            </p>

            <p>
                In March 2025 I released my first "proper" game, a rogue-like called <em>Star Mining Co.</em> which is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2584800/">Steam!</a>
                <br/>
                I made it from scratch in Java using <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> as a library to handle all the graphics and what not. It's probably not the most sane choice, but it works for me and I find it more enjoyable than using an engine (this is probably the software engineer in me coming out)!
            </p>

            <h2>What I'm up to now:</h2>
            <p>
                I'm always tinkering on something, whether it's a new game, a prototpye, a library, or something <a href="https://youtube.com/@Barnso">in the real world</a>!
            </p>
            <p>
                When I get the time, I share tutorials and devlogs on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@BarneyCodes">YouTube Channel</a> 
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of coding I'm quite an active person, I really enjoy rock climbing (indoor, outdoor, bouldering, top rope, lead, you name it!), running, cycling, hiking, and camping. I also have a tiny little vege patch on my balcony where I grow sweet potatoes, tomatoes, and some herbs.
                <br/>
                I've played the guitar for far more years than my skills would suggest, but that's because I mostly just noodle rather than practice with anything resembling dedication!
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sure I'll have missed out some hobbies and interests, there never seems to be enough time to do all the things I want to do!
            </p>

            <h2>Get in touch!</h2>
            <p>
                The best way to get in touch is probably either on <a href="https://discord.gg/Qnc3jWTeEW">Discord</a> or via <a href="mailto:barney@barneycodes.com?subject=Getting%20in%20touch">Email</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cheers, and happy coding!
