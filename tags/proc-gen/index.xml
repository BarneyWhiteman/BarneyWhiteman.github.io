      <description>While creating the game Unexpect Orcs, we needed a way to generate the dungeon levels. We had a look at some existing methods, for example Bob Nystrom&amp;rsquo;s brilliant method where he connects rooms with mazes.
For the most part we found that, while these generators were good, they didn&amp;rsquo;t really suit what we were after, We wanted to keep the rooms of our dungeons separated by corridors to keep that cramped feeling, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to use that whoever was building these dungeons would make the routes between rooms so indirect, so we decided to address that and make our own generator!</description>
