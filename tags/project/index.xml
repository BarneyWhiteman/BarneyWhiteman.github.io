      <description>Unexpected Orcs is an unfinshed (and sadly abandoned) bullet-hell Action RPG with roguelike elements. It is the spiritual successor to the unreleased flash game of the same name created by the same team of me and my cousins (circa 2011).
The project is written in a custom Java engine that uses Processing to handle the graphics side of things.
You can find the code for the project on GitHub.
Below are a few screenshots that I took over the course of development with a few brief notes sprinkled in for taste.</description>

      <description>Below are a collection of gifs from various little projects I&amp;rsquo;ve done. None of them are really big enough to warrent their own post, but I think that they&amp;rsquo;re fun to look at and wanted to share them.
These were all made using Processing. I&amp;rsquo;ve also linked GitHub repos where applicable.
If you have any questions regarding any of these or would like more information, feel free to get in touch!</description>
