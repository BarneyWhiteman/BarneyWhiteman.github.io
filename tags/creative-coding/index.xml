      <description>Below are a collection of gifs from various little projects I&amp;rsquo;ve done. None of them are really big enough to warrent their own post, but I think that they&amp;rsquo;re fun to look at and wanted to share them.
These were all made using Processing. I&amp;rsquo;ve also linked GitHub repos where applicable.
If you have any questions regarding any of these or would like more information, feel free to get in touch!</description>
