          	<h1>Custom Dungeon Generation</h1>
          	<p>3rd Feb 2020</p>
			<hr class="my-4">
			<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        	<p>
				While creating the game <a href="/projects/unexpectedOrcs">Unexpect Orcs</a>, my team and I needed a way to generate the dungeon levels. We initially implement a fairly basic algorthim;
				Randomly place <i>n</i> rooms and then randomly connect them to each other with "L" shaped corridors. While this certainly works, and was enough to get the ball rolling on the project,
				it left a bit to be desired.
				<br/>
				This article detials the method that is currently being used for generating the Cellar Dungeon in Unexpected Orcs. The method is made to be pretty versatile and can generate a a wide variety 
				of dungeons with completely different feels. It's currently under-utilised in the game, but hopefully this article will demonstrate its usefullness.
				<br/>
          		The generation can be broken down into three main steps:
				<ol>
					<li>Place rooms</li>
					<li>Connect rooms</li>
					<li>Fill with tiles</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<hr class="my-4">
          <h5>1. Placing rooms</h5>
          Placing the rooms is the most difficult step in this algorithm, this is where all the magic happens. After the step has run you end up with something like the image below. Each numbered box
          represents a room and each red line is the theoretical connection between them.
          <div class="photoCluster">
            <img src="../images/progressShots/LevelGraph.png" alt="Room Placement"/>
          </div>
          To get to this stage, the generator needs a bit of information. It takes a few room prefabs (hand built rooms made with our custom level builder), these are the spawn and boss rooms as well as a list 
          of rooms that can be used to fill in the gaps. Along with these rooms, the generator is also given information about the maximum number of rooms, the closeness of the rooms to each other as 
          well as the "spread" (I'll explain what the spread is in just a moment).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          To start off the generation, the spawn room is set as the initial room from which all other rooms are placed. A random direction is chosen to be the overall "direction" of the dungeon. 
          With those starting conditions, the rest of the room placement can begin. The placements are made by choosing a random, already placed room, along with a random angle. This angle is determined 
          by a combination of the dungeon's "direction" and the "spread", essentially just a random angle defined by: direction + random(-spread, spread). Then a random distance is chosen between the 
          minimum and maximum closeness. If the chosen placement of the room results in a collision with already placed rooms, the placment is discarded and retried.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          During this process, the "depth" of each room is stored, that is the number of corridors needed to get to travel to the spawn room (for example: in the image above, room 8 would have a depth of 3).
          It is also important to keep track of which rooms connect with which other rooms, this will allow us to generate the corridors later.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Once the maximum number of rooms have been placed, we can finally place the boss room. There are many ways this could be done, the way I decided to implement this was to place it using the previous
          method but instead of using a random room to connect it to, I used the "deepest" room in the dungeon. I'm not entirely happy with this, but I will talk more about this when discussing the short comings 
          of this approach at the end.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          By following these steps, you end up with a situation that looks like the image above. At this point, only the location of the rooms is know, and which room connects to which. The next step is to
          turn those theoretical connections into actual corridors.
          <hr class="my-4">
          <h5>2. Creating corridors</h5>
          This step is relatively straight forward compared to the previous one, we already know which rooms need to be connected and we know where those rooms are placed. All we need to figure out is which
          actual tiles to take to get there. If that sounds like a pathfinding problem to you, you'd be absolutely right!
          <div class="photoCluster">
            <img src="../images/progressShots/LevelMap.png" alt="Corridor Placement"/>
          </div>
          I specifically use the A* pathfinding algorithm and this is for a number of reasons.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Firstly, A* finds the shortest path (if it exists) between the start and the goal nodes. Both the Depth-First-Search (DFS), and the Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithms will find <i>a</i> path, but
          not necessarily the <i>shortest</i> path. For dungeons that are supposed to man-made (well... depending on your game, not man, maybe dwarves? Orcs?..), I personally think it makes more sense to
          have direct corridors.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Since we are also on a grid system and we know the locations of both where we are starting and where we want to end up, A* also has an advantage over Dijkstra's algorithm. This is that we can bias
          our pathfinding in the direction of goal which should give us a speed boost. In practice, I doubt that it would help much since the search area is pretty small, but it's trivial to go from Dijkstra's
          to A*.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          So now that we've got our search algorithm sorted, we just need to run it! For each connection between rooms, we find the shortest path between their centres. Before adding a tile to the queue, 
          we need to check if that tile is "valid". This is a pretty simple check; Are we in a room that isn't the start room or the goal room? (This includes the walls surronding the room, which for
          us is not included in the room's definition) You don't want to mess up the beautiful prefabs!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We don't, however, need to worry about pathfinding arround other corridors. When we ignore the other corridors, it opens up the possibility of forked corridors as well as corridors that are more
          than 1 tile wide (Both of these can be seen in this example, there is split corridors between rooms 0, 1, and 2. There is a 2-wide corridor leaving room 10 on the left).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Thats it! Corridors done and dusted. What we're left with is the positions of the rooms and the corridors, now it's time to turn them into tiles!
          <hr class="my-4">
          <h5>3. Filling in the tiles</h5>
