			<p>I&rsquo;m Barney, a software engineer based in Brisbane, Australia. I work as a full stack developer but in my spare time I enjoy creating games, desktop apps and creating visual interactions.<br>
I started coding when I was 12 years old by making (terrible) flash games, during high school I started learning Python and HTML/CSS and continued to make (terrible) games. I furthered my programming journey by studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Hons) at the University of Queensland, from which I graduated in 2019.</p>
<p>There are a number of hobbies I enjoy outside the world of programming as well. I play guitar and build things, I like to keep active by playing social sports, rock climbing, and running. I also let my inner oldie come out by tending to my vege garden, reading books, drinking tea, and doing crochet.</p>
