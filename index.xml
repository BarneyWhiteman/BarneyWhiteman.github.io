      <description>On my YouTube channel I make videos on coding challenges. These challenges are mostly done using the Processing language due to its simple-to-use nature, however some of the more recent ones use P5js which is Processing JavaScript cousin.
  You can find the Processing code for my videos on GitHub.
The P5js code can be found on the online editor.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Barney, a software engineer based in Brisbane, Australia. I work as a full stack developer but in my spare time I enjoy creating games, desktop apps and creating visual interactions.
I started coding when I was 12 years old by making (terrible) flash games, during high school I started learning Python and HTML/CSS and continued to make (terrible) games. I furthered my programming journey by studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Hons) at the University of Queensland, from which I graduated in 2019.</description>

      <description>The game I was working on (Unexpected Orcs, sadly unfinished) used tile-based terrain, and in an effort to give it more visual appeal, my team and I thought &amp;ldquo;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool if we could give the walls a bit of perspective and have borders between different tile types&amp;rdquo;. Of course, we weren&amp;rsquo;t the first to think this and we almost certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be the last. We did a bit of research and came across the technique of bitmasking tile textures, this article was particularly helpful (I highly recommend reading that article first if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what tile bitmasking is, it explains it much better than me and has pretty pictures.</description>

      <description>While creating the game Unexpect Orcs, we needed a way to generate the dungeon levels. We had a look at some existing methods, for example Bob Nystrom&amp;rsquo;s brilliant method where he connects rooms with mazes.
For the most part we found that, while these generators were good, they didn&amp;rsquo;t really suit what we were after, We wanted to keep the rooms of our dungeons separated by corridors to keep that cramped feeling, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to use that whoever was building these dungeons would make the routes between rooms so indirect, so we decided to address that and make our own generator!</description>

      <description>Unexpected Orcs is an unfinshed (and sadly abandoned) bullet-hell Action RPG with roguelike elements. It is the spiritual successor to the unreleased flash game of the same name created by the same team of me and my cousins (circa 2011).
The project is written in a custom Java engine that uses Processing to handle the graphics side of things.
You can find the code for the project on GitHub.
Below are a few screenshots that I took over the course of development with a few brief notes sprinkled in for taste.</description>

      <description>Below are a collection of gifs from various little projects I&amp;rsquo;ve done. None of them are really big enough to warrent their own post, but I think that they&amp;rsquo;re fun to look at and wanted to share them.
These were all made using Processing. I&amp;rsquo;ve also linked GitHub repos where applicable.
If you have any questions regarding any of these or would like more information, feel free to get in touch!</description>
